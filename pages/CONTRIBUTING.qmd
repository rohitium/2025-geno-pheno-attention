## Getting started

If you haven't already, follow our [setup guide](SETUP.qmd) to create a local copy of the code and compute environment.

## Make your changes

Edit `index.ipynb` to your liking.

## Steps before publishing

To publish your revisions, we need you to open a pull request. And in order for us to merge your pull request, here's what we'll need from you in addition to your content changes.

Begin with a clean branch (no uncommitted changes). Then run the notebook from the command line:

```bash
make execute
```

This command will update `index.ipynb` with the latest execution results.

Then run `make preview` to see how the publication is rendering. Verify that your changes appear how you intend them to appear. If not, make the necessary changes and re-run `make execute`.

Once everything looks good, commit `index.ipynb` and all files in the `_freeze/` directory.

Finally, submit a pull request and we'll work with you to merge your changes.

Once we approve and merge your pull request, we'll publish a new version of the pub. We'll notify you when this new version goes live at the [hosted URL](https://{{< var pub.org >}}.github.io/{{< var pub.repo >}}/). Thanks for contributing!
