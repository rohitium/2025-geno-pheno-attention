# Developer Documentation

This directory contains documentation for developers who maintain or use the notebook publication template.

## Contents

- [Environment Setup Guide](ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md) - How to set up your development environment
- [Publishing Guide](PUBLISHING_GUIDE.md) - How to publish your notebook publication
- [Template Architecture](TEMPLATE_ARCHITECTURE.md) - Understanding the template's structure and components

## Purpose

These documents are intended to provide clarity on:

1. How to properly set up and use the template
2. Which files in the template are safe to edit and which should not be modified
3. The overall architecture and dependencies of the template
4. The complete publishing workflow

This documentation is particularly useful for developers who need to maintain or update the template itself, as well as for users who want a deeper understanding of how the template works.
